	<p> Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with someone 
	who makes you feel alone. Being lonely doesn't hurt as much 
	as being with someone who makes you feel insecure about yourself. 
	Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with someone who doesn't 
	know how to treat you right. Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as 
	being with someone who doesn't have enough patience to understand you. 
	Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with someone who makes you 
	feel like everything is always your fault. Being lonely doesn't hurt 
	as much as being with someone who makes you feel like you're crazy when 
	you have every reason to be upset. Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as 
	being with someone who makes you feel like you're worthless in an argument. 
	Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with someone who always finds 
	someone new to care about. Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with  someone who lies to you over and over again. Being lonely doesn't hurt as 
	much as being with someone who takes away all of the love you have for  yourself. Being lonely doesn't hurt as much as being with someone who 
	doesn't love you enough to realize what your worth and value is. 
	Being lonely may hurt, but it won't break your heart again. 
	Love can wait. </p>
