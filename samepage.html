    <p> To the girl who's reading this,
It may hurt for now, but it won't hurt forever. It may feel like you could have done things differently with him, but everything happened the way they did for a reason. It may feel like you've lost a part of yourself, but know that you've actually gained back a part of yourself. It may feel like it was your fault why things didn't work out, but be reassured that you've done everything you possibly could to save it. It may be difficult to not talk to him, but it gets easier little by little every day. It may be hard to not be around him, but you'll get used to being by yourself within time. It may be hard to delete all of those memories you've shared with him, but understand that it'll only bring you back to a place you don't want to be. It may be hard to not think about him, but you'll eventually find yourself being surrounded by people who are actually worth being in your thoughts. It may be hard to feel like everything is going to be okay, but you're the only one who can make sure of that. It may be tough to see him with another girl, but there will come a day where you'll be able to look him and be happy for him. It may take a long time for you to move on from him, but the moment you're completely over him is the moment you'll realize that you've learned how to love yourself again.... you got this. </p>

    <p> A guy will only change for the girl he thinks is worth it. You can't ask him to change. You can't force him to change. You can't beg him to change. He has to want to change on his own without you having to tell him to do it. You could remind him of his mistakes over and over again, you could bring up all of the times he fucked up as much as you want, and you could show him how much he hurts you every day, but until it hits him that he should become a better man, until he realizes that he should work on himself, and until he realizes that he should love you the way you deserve to be loved, he won't change. But, if you're special to him, if he appreciates you enough, if there's the right amount of love there, then he will change for you and be everything you need him to be because when a guy thinks you're worth it, there's nothing he wouldn't do for you. Your needs would come before his. If you're not happy, he isn't happy. He would selflessly put you before him without question or hesitation. So if you have a man who has changed for you, then you're lucky because not every man comes across a girl who he thinks is worth it. If your man hasn't changed for you despite everything you've been thru with him, then maybe you should be with a man who's able to see that you're worth it instead and quit wasting yourself with the one you're with now, regardless of how much you love him. If he loved you, like truly loved you, he would have changed by now, so if he hasn't, he never will.</p>

    <p> Dear girl,
You gotta understand the difference between a man who speaks to you on his free time and a man who frees his time to speak to you. You gotta understand the difference between a man who spends his time with you when he's not too busy and a man who's never too busy to spend time with you. You gotta understand the difference between a man who wants to see you because he misses you and a man who misses you enough to go actually see you. You gotta understand the difference between a man who tries to make an effort and a man who makes an effort to try. You gotta understand the difference between a man who talks to a lot of girls including you and a man who only talks to you instead of a lot of girls. You gotta understand the difference between a man who gets mad because you ask for too much and a man who gets mad because he wishes he can give you more. You gotta understand the difference between a man who loves to hurt you and a man who gets hurt because he loves you. And once you understand the difference, you'll know if you're with the right guy or not.

    <h2>(#section4) Section 4</h2>
    <p> Every relationship gets boring and it will get boring after you've been together for years. It's always fun in the beginning. It's always exciting when you're getting to know each other. It's always thrilling to chase one another. Eventually, it gets hard. Eventually, it becomes difficult. Eventually, it drains you. That's when people tend to quit and go look for someone else because "the spark is gone" and they want to feel wanted and admired and loved again. But listen, that's not how it's supposed to be. No, that's not how it works. It doesn't have to be that way. Even when it does get boring, that's when you're supposed to remember why you're with that person in the first place and it's never too late to find that happiness that you both once found together because the truth is, it's always been there and it never left. Even when it feels like feelings are fading, that's when you're supposed to know how much this person means to you and what losing them would be like because being able to love someone even when they're being hard to love shows that your feelings never left. Even when it feels like you're done, that's when you're supposed to realize that no matter who you're with, it's always going to get "boring" so you might as well be with someone who's willing to love you unconditionally and never give up on you.

    <p> To the Man Who Made Me Whole Again
When you came into my life, I was a wreck. I don’t know where I was in life. Though I was doing things I want, I felt things were still wrong. Even if I always smile, I still felt empty. I knew my heart was still shattered by the past; I knew there was something missing all along. Yet, your presence has become my only reason to go on and let go of all the uncertainties and frustrations. 
At first you were the risk I had to take; I was so scared. I was so scared to suffer the pain once more, to be devastated again. Yet your amazing love overpowered me. You picked up all my broken pieces and put them back piece by piece even if I refused. You made your way on putting an effort of making me smile again. You have my sweet appreciation for taking my smile places I only dreamed of. You made my eyes sparkle again like it never did before. You helped me bring back the life I have lost, the self I already forgotten, and the love I longed for. You made me believe in the power of love again. 
Thank you for being the person who can embrace my silliness, who joins me in my absurdity and who doesn’t ask me to change my actuation because you have wholeheartedly accepted me. Thank you for being honest to me; the person I can trust with all my secrets and crazy stories that I have kept within myself. Thank you for listening to my endless talks and understanding every bit of me. Thank you for telling me I am beautiful even with allergies, tired or pale. Thank you for always reminding me that I can be myself and still be loved, even on my worst or weakest days. Thank you for making me feel that I am more than enough; that I don’t need to impress you because you are already impressed by me and by who I am and by being with me and by loving me.
I just can’t thank you enough for making me whole again; for giving me the love that I deserve. Remember that you always have my love, you will always have me. I love you.
