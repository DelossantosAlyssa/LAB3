  <h1> <center> Truth Slap </center> </h1>
  She misses you, but she won't chase you. For the longest time, she's tried to be good enough for you. For the longest time, she did her best to make you happy. For the longest time, she's done everything she could to show you she deserves a guy like you. But finally, she can't find it in herself to make an effort anymore. Finally, she can't find it in herself to care as much anymore. Finally, she can't find it herself to fight for you anymore. Every mistake you've made has finally caught up to her. Every flaw you carry has finally convinced her that you're bad for her. Every heartbreak you put her thru has finally pushed her far enough to not want to come back anymore. So, don't expect her to come running back to you like she always has before. Don't expect her to give in to her feelings for you like she always did in the past. Don't expect her to settle for getting hurt over you like she always does all of this time.  It took a lot of "I'm dones", it took a lot of "I don't think I can do this anymores", it took a lot of "It's overs", but she's really finished this time around. Sure, it's going to be hard to be alone, but she'd rather be alone than to be with someone who makes her feel like she'd rather be alone. Sure, it's going to hurt to move on, but she'd rather be hurt moving on than to be hurt by someone who doesn't appreciate her staying. Sure, it's going to be a challenge to love someone again, but she'd rather love someone again once she's ready than to love someone who takes her love for granted.
